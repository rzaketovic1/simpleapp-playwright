# SimpleApp – User Register POST Request with Playwright E2E & API Tests

#  Project Overview

This is a demo application that showcases a basic user registration form with API built with ASP.NET Core, along with tests written in Playwright.

- A single endpoint: `/api/register`
- Client-side and server-side validation for username and password fields
- End-to-end and API test coverage using Playwright
- CI pipeline integration via GitHub Actions

# 3. User Story

## Title: User Registration – Validation and Verification

**As a** new user of the application,
**I want** to register by entering a valid username and password,
**So that** I can register a user.

**Acceptance Criteria**

Username Field
- Must be at least 6 characters long

Password Field
- Must be at least 6 characters long
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number

Form Behavior
- Invalid inputs should show immediate UI error message
- Backend must reject invalid data with proper error messages
- Successful registration should return 201 status and a success message

What We Test
- Validation: Does the system prevent the user from submitting invalid inputs?
- Verification: Does the backend return the expected results, regardless of the UI?



# 4. Test Plan

This project includes automated UI and API tests using Playwright.

## UI Scenarios

Register Page – Name Field

✅ Positive

- should accept valid name and submit form successfully
- should accept name with exactly 6 characters

❌ Negative

- should reject name shorter than 6 characters
- should reject empty name field

Register Page – Password Field

✅ Positive

- should accept password and create user
- should accept password with exactly 6 valid characters

❌ Negative

- should reject empty password
- should reject password shorter than 6 characters
- should reject password without uppercase letter
- should reject password without lowercase letter
- should reject password without number

UI tests are implemented using POM pattern with registerPage:

UI Test Code: https://github.com/rzaketovic1/simpleapp-playwright/blob/main/SimpleApp_Playwright/tests/register-ui.spec.ts




## API Scenarios

- POST /api/register
- Returns 201 Created on valid data
- Returns 400 Bad Request with error message



Register API – Name Validation

- should return 201 for valid name and password

npx playwright show-report
```

# 6.  Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

GitHub Actions is configured to:

- Build the backend
- Start the server in the background
- Run Playwright tests (UI & API)

Workflow file:

.github/workflows/tests.yml

Example job execution can be viewed under the Actions tab on GitHub: https://github.com/rzaketovic1/simpleapp-playwright/actions/runs/14560149324/job/40842352598
